Lib: Message verification in consumer

Config: think about it more
 - databases are for all events
 - statusnet & email filter by ident and have their own process
 - should jabber be like a database or statusnet/email?
 - does the jabber code change or does the config/launcher change?
 (abstraction - each service has a type - all or filtered
   option filters:
   launch individual process for each
   each output plugin has it's own syntax
   options: ???
   or just use everything else? ie:
   statusnet:
     all: false
     filters:
       - git
       - centos
     options:
       git:
         user: git
         password: gitgit
       centos:
         user: centos
         password: centos
   jabber:
     all: true
     options:
       user: eventasaurus@couchdb
       password: event
       room: tech@conferences.couchdb
       nick: eventasaurus
   jabber:
     all: false
     filters:
       - git
     options:
       git:
         user: gitasaurus@couchdb
         password: gitgit
         room: tech@conferences.couchdb
